# Ruby-libUI Starter
This uses [LibUI-ruby](https://github.com/jamescook/libui-ruby) and includes a compiled version of [LibUI](https://github.com/andlabs/libui) which was built on mac osx 10.11.4.

# Reason for this repo
I made this only because I wanted to quickly get started working with the
library and the ruby binding to understand and contribute back to both projects.
